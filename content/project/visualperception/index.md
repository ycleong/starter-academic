title: Motivated visual perception
summary: Individuals with different motivations often report seeing the same image differently, but it is unclear whether this reflects a bias in what they *see* or what they *report* seeing. Can people with diverse goals and motives truly perceive the same visual stimuli differently? In recent work, I combined computational modeling and fMRI to provide a neurocomputational account of how motivation biases visual perception.

Individuals with different motivations often report seeing the same image differently, but it remains disputed whether this reflects a bias in what they see or what they report seeing. Can people with diverse goals and motives truly perceive the same visual stimuli differently? I re-examined this decades-old problem in my graduate work. I used fMRI to measure the neural responses of participants as they viewed ambiguous images created by morphing together a face and a scene. Participants were rewarded for correctly judging whether the image contained ‘more face’ or ‘more scene’. On each trial, I motivated them to see one of the categories by instructing them that they would earn a bonus if the image contained more of that category. This bonus depended on the objective category of the image, and not participants’ reports. As such, even though participants were motivated to see the category associated with the bonus, they should categorize the images objectively to maximize their earnings.

I found that participants were nevertheless biased to categorize the images as the category they were motivated to see. If motivation altered perceptual experience, we would expect to observe a corresponding effect on neural representations in the category-selective visual cortex. Indeed, for a given image, face-selective neural activity was higher when participants were motivated to see more face, while scene-selective activity was higher when they were motivated to see more scene. Motivationally biased judgments were associated with increased activity in frontoparietal regions that I had previously found to be involved in the reward-modulated control of attention, suggesting a potential source of top-down signals driving these effects. Using a computational model, I further showed that participants’ motivational bias could be decomposed into an a priori bias to respond in a motivation-consistent manner (i.e. a ‘response’ bias), as well as a bias in the accumulation of sensory information (i.e. a ‘perceptual’ bias). The response bias was associated with anticipatory activity in the nucleus accumbens, a striatal structure implicated in reward processing and action selection. In contrast, the perceptual bias tracked modulations in category-selective neural activity in the visual cortex. Together, these results not only demonstrate that motivation biases perception, but also provide a neurocomputational account of how this occurs.
