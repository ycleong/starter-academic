title: Communication and shared experiences
summary: In a separate line of work, my collaborators and I have studied the neural bases of human communication. We found that (1) experiencing, (2) talking about and (3) listening to a verbal description of an event elicits shared patterns of neural activity across individuals. The fidelity of this neural pattern correlated with communication success. These results suggest that communication is associated with the construction of shared neural representations.

In a separate line of work, my collaborators and I have studied the neural bases of communication. We found that experiencing, recalling and listening to a verbal description of an event elicited shared patterns of neural activity across individuals. Furthermore, the fidelity of this neural pattern correlated with memory performance and comprehension. These results suggest that communication is associated with the construction of shared neural representations.
