title: Communication and shared experiences
summary: In a separate line of work, my collaborators and I have studied the neural bases of human communication. We found that (1) experiencing, (2) talking about and (3) listening to a verbal description of an event elicits shared patterns of neural activity across individuals. The fidelity of this neural pattern correlated with communication success. These results suggest that communication is associated with the construction of shared neural representations.

A (beautiful) feature of human experience is that we don't have to experience everything ourselves. Through the stories we tell one another, we can, to a degree, experience the life of another. 

In work with collaborators, I have explored the neural underpinnings of how people talk to and understand each other. We scanned participants watching a 50-minute movie clip and talking about the plot immediately afterwards. We show that watching and talking about the same scene elicits a similar pattern of neural activity. The pattern was also shared across people talking about the same scene, revealing the existence of a common 'neural code' that could serve as the foundation for human communication <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4450" target="_blank">[1]</a>. 

In a second study, we scanned a group of participants who had not watched the movie as they listened to someone talking about the movie. We found that listening to the speaker talk about a scene elicited a pattern of neural activity that was similar to that of the speaker watching that scene, despite participants not having seen the movie themselves <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/27/10/4988/4080827" target="_blank">[2]</a>. Together, these results suggest that communication is associated with the construction and transmission of shared neural representations.
